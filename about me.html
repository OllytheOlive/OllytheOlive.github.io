       Hi my name Seung Hyun Lee .If it is hard to pronounce it's fine you can just call me Olivia.That is what my friends call me.I come from a Korean family ,I am 12 years old and my favorite things in the world to do is learn about animals and babysit animals.My second favorite thing to do is acting.I don't enjoy acting as much as I like to study about animals but my drama teacher thinks I have a talent in acting.Let me ask you a question did  you ever wonder about what your future carrer is going to be??? I have two things in mind.The career that I am  mostly going for is being a veternarian.WHY?? Well first of all when I am having a horrible day animals  always make me the happiest girl in the world. Adults always told me to get a job where you always enjoy your job that you could work without resting because it is the most fun  thing in the whole wide WOORRLLDD!!
        Furthermore, I have a very strong passion of all sorts of animals.One of my favorite animals are  Horses,Dogs,Hamsters,Guinea Pigs, Chinchilla, Pigs ,Dolphins, Pandas, Red Pandas, and all the animals in the world.So you might ask what kind of veternarian do you want to be ? Well I want to be a  veternarian who works at a zoos and who works at a pet hospital.Furthermore,since I have a talent in acting I could use my talent to make enough money for myself.If you think about it there are some good and bad things about being an actress.The good thing is that after you take the movie you get to walk on the red carpet.Or if the movie you made became a hit you can even win the Oscar award like Jennifer Lawrence or like Brie Larson.The bad news is that you can't get enough sleep.That is a huge problem about me. I can't get enough strength with six or seven hours.I need 
        at least ten or twelve hours of sleep. If I do become an actress I would like to be a movie and a drama actress.In conclusion, I am going for a veternarian.  In  twenty or twenty  something years later I will write again and I will tell you  about what happened and the story of my life.Wish me luck !!!
