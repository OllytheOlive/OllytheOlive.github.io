      Hello and welcome to my animals kingdom . You might have lots of animals in mind but it is time for me to answer your question. It is a mammal,a four legged animal,it is very colorful,it can not be a pet.You can see this animal at the zoo or at the circus.The most biggest hint.IT HAS BLACK AND WHITE FUR !Yup you might have been wrong or right.Zebras have for legs and two eyes.They are very smelly and it is 770 to
        900 lb.It can not be a pet and it might be rude like a donkey.It comes from the horse ,donkey,mule familya.
